This project consists of two versions:
  1. The notes that the user creates and interacts with are loaded from local storage
  2. The notes that the user creates and interacts with are stored in the firestore database

Although the first and original version is available for viewing in the V1 - Local Storage folder, the project is currently configured and operating around the second version. There are some stretch goals that I plan on implementing such as requiring authentication before being permitted to make requests to the database, and also enabling responsiveness.
